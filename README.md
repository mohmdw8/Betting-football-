Intelligent Sports Prediction System 🤖🔮⚽

This project is an advanced script 🚀 designed to provide you with the best possible sports match predictions 🎯, leveraging a unique blend of complex data 📊, deep analysis 🧠, and Artificial Intelligence 🤖.

**How the Script Works:**

1.  **Core Data Collection:** The script initially relies on accurate and detailed data fetched from Sofascore 📈⚽.
2.  **Complex Computational Algorithms and Proprietary Model:** After data collection, the script applies a set of complex computational algorithms and analyses 🧠🔢 that I have spent a full year studying and developing 🧑‍💻📚 to derive the optimal statistical rules and models 💡⚙️. These rules are capable of predicting vital metrics such as:
    *   Correct match scores ✅.
    *   Goal-scoring percentages for each team or the match as a whole 🥅⚽.
    *   Expected number of corners 🚩.
    *   And other precise statistics.
3.  **Artificial Intelligence Analysis:** In the final step, all this collected information and the results extracted from the computational processes are fed into an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model 🧠➡️🤖. The AI deeply analyzes this complex data to generate the most accurate and best final predictions based on learned patterns and relationships 🔮✨.

**Flexible Usage:**

The script has been designed to be flexible and capable of running seamlessly across all devices 📱💻, including smartphones 📲, making it accessible and convenient for everyone.

**Script Operation (User Experience):**

The process of using the script is simple and guided 👍, proceeding through the following steps:

1.  **Select the Day:** The script begins by asking you which matches you wish to analyze: today's matches or tomorrow's matches? 🗓️❓
2.  **Select the League:** After selecting the date, all available leagues for that chosen day/date will be displayed 🏆🗺️. You then select the league of interest to you ⚽, and all matches within that league will be presented.
3.  **Select Classification (Key to Accuracy 🔑):** Before the analysis begins, the script allows you to choose one of two available classifications 📁, which represent the depth of data used to enhance accuracy:
    *   **Classification 1:** Consists of two parts:
        *   **Part 1:** Retrieves statistics and data for the selected league from the **current season** 🆕.
        *   **Part 2:** Retrieves statistics and data for the selected league from the **previous season** 🔙.
    *   **Classification 2:** Also consists of two parts, specifically designed to increase accuracy 🎯 when a team is playing in a continental or international competition 🌍🏆, by calculating averages across two competitions 📊:
        *   **Part 1:** Calculates average statistics by combining data from the team's continental/international competition and its domestic league from the **current season** 🆕.
        *   **Part 2:** Calculates average statistics by combining data from the team's domestic league from the **current season** 🆕 with its continental/international competition data from the **previous season** 🔙. This part is utilized if insufficient information is available for the current season in the continental/international competition 🧐.
4.  **Start Analysis and Get Predictions:** Once all required selections are made, the script commences its complex calculations and analyses as described above ▶️🚀, ultimately providing you with the best possible predictions 🔮🎯, including anticipated correct scores ✅.


(You can run it on any terminal that supports Python.)
